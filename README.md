# Audio-Amplifier
A simple audio amplifier, intended to drive larger (>25Î©) headphones.

I chose Polypropylene as the material for my input capacitor, as they tend to have a lower distortion than others, at the
expense of a larger form factor. 0.47uF lowered the -3dB point to 3Hz, which should exhibit acceptable filtering once
the minimum range of human hearing is reached.

The 1000uF electrolytic on the power supply is likely overkill, but it certainly doesn't hurt to have if the headphones 
end up drawing large current spikes during loud parts of songs.

# To Do
I want to find a nice form factor to house the board. I'm thinking a wooden box would look sleek and has the advantage of 
being largely non-conductive.
